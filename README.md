# How this can be improved

Additional Data Sources:
Integrate the LinkedIn or Crunchbase API to supplement the data on founders and growth metrics. LinkedIn can confirm founder names, and Crunchbase can provide investment rounds or growth rates.

Open Graph Metadata Extraction:
Many websites have metadata that describes the business, product, or team. Using a simple Open Graph parser could help pull additional structured information, especially for newer startups.
Growth Metrics:

Implement keyword scanning or LLM analysis to search for mentions of funding rounds, partnerships, or new product launches. These indicators suggest the startupâ€™s growth potential.

# Further questions

## Why build https://www.pitchleague.ai?

Competition motivates founders to use the site more. This creates a wider user base and provides Sequel with more data to use. 

## How to combine information from pitch decks and crawling websites?

Vector databases can be used, where data from pitch decks and websites is embedded. The claims in the pitch deck can be validated through the website data and monitored over time to see if their objectives are being met. More information, from alternative data sources, can be added too.
